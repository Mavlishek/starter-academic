abstract: Games provide a variety of experiences for players. Currently,
  research focuses either on games as undifferentiated wholes, or on a
  feature-level basis where findings are difficult to generalise. However,
  specific gaming experiences cannot be explained from these approaches. Open
  world games in particular are a popular game type known for giving players
  high levels of choice over what they do, thus enabling uniquely different
  experiences. Current approaches cannot capture what about this gaming
  experience players enjoy or why. To do so requires a ‘contextually-specific’
  approach, demonstrated in this paper by interviewing eleven players of open
  world games about their experiences. A thematic analysis showed what they
  believed the open world to be, as well as how the experience is enabled. Five
  concepts interlock together to enable the final theme; (1) players are
  situated to scale within the world, (2) the world is large, connected and
  accessible, (3) the main goal does not restrict players from engaging with
  other activities, (4) content density is more important than world size, and
  (5) players self-pace gameplay through engaging/disengaging with tasks at
  will. This study highlights how the use of a contextually-specific approach
  provides insight into specific player experiences, and why players enjoy them.
