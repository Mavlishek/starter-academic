A 6-month project in collaboration with the Advanced Tools & Concepts Team of the National Air Traffic Service (NATS) Research & Development department.

The project explored how automated decision-making tools could be introduced to air traffic control, in a way that allowed safety to be assured. This was done with a focus on human-machine teaming and took a user-centred design approach.
