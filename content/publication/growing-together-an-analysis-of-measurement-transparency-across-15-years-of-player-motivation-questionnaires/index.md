abstract: There are many questionnaires to assess player motivation, originating
  from a diverse range of disciplines. Each discipline differs in their usage
  and reporting of questionnaires, but there has been no attempt to standardise
  their application. No standard approach leads to a lack of transparency in
  usage reporting, which affects the ability of the field to synthesise. This
  has made it unclear whether player motivation research is a unified community,
  or a collection of individuals with a similar goal. Therefore, the current
  work assesses the transparency of reporting practices of player motivation
  questionnaires published within the last 15 years. 18 questionnaires were
  identified via a scoping review, then papers citing these questionnaires were
  analysed for their transparency of reporting practices (n = 238); first via a
  content analysis of justifications for use, then followed by an analysis of
  transparency against eight criteria created for this work. Overall, reporting
  transparency is lacking, driven by little priority for presenting items
  alongside text. Many papers use questionnaires because they are theory-based
  or have measured specific variables in previous works, but explicit
  justification is rare. The work concludes with a transparency checklist based
  on the eight criteria used, which authors can use to standardise the field and
  allow for more cohesive research synthesis.

summary: There are numerous player questionnaires available for use. There is no
  agreed best practice on how these should be used and reported. The current
  work analyses 238 papers that use these questionnaires and why. There is an
  overall lack of transparency in the use and reporting of questionnaires. A
  checklist to help researchers transparently report questionnaires is provided.
