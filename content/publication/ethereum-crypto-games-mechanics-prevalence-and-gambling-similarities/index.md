abstract: Ethereum crypto-games are a booming and relatively unexplored area of
  the games industry. While there is no consensus definition yet, 'crypto-games'
  commonly denotes games that store tokens, e.g. in-game items, on a distributed
  ledger atop a cryptocurrency network. This enables the trading of game items
  for cryptocurrency, which can then be exchanged for regular currency. Together
  with their chance-based mechanics, this makes crypto-games part of the recent
  convergence of digital gaming and gambling. In a first effort to scope the
  field, this paper surveys popular crypto-games, which use the Ethereum
  cryptocurrency, to tease out characteristic technical properties and gameplay.
  It then compares the games' features with criteria found in current legal and
  psychological definitions of gambling. We find that the popular crypto-games
  selected meet a combined legal and psychological definition of gambling, and
  conclude with ramifications for future research.
